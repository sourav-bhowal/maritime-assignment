# Senior Backend Engineer — Evaluation Assignment

## Smart Maritime Document Extractor (SMDE)

---

**Role:** Senior Backend Engineer
**Time Estimate:** 4–6 hours
**Submission Deadline:** 5 days from receipt
**Submission Format:**  GitHub repository + Architecture Decision Record (ADR) document + 10–15 min Loom walkthrough

**Submission**: Email your completed assignment (GitHub repo + demo video) to hiring**@skycladventures.com**

---

## What This Assignment Is Testing

This is not a pure coding challenge. We are hiring someone who will both write backend code and lead the team building this product. The submission has three parts that are weighted equally:

1. **The working service** — a backend API that processes maritime documents through an LLM pipeline
2. **A written Architecture Decision Record** — explaining the choices you made and the tradeoffs you rejected
3. **A code review response** — you will receive a junior engineer's PR to review; your written feedback is evaluated as leadership output

We are looking for evidence of three things across all three parts:

- Technical depth — you understand the hard parts and handle them deliberately
- Architectural judgment — you make defensible decisions and know what you are deferring
- Leadership communication — your writing is clear enough to grow a junior engineer and align a product manager

---

## Context

We are building a system that allows maritime Manning Agents to upload seafarer certification documents — certificates, medical exams, passports, drug tests — and extract structured data from them automatically using a vision-capable LLM.

Instead of building a rigid parser with hardcoded fields per document type, we use an LLM to:

1. Detect what type of document was uploaded
2. Determine whether it belongs to a Deck or Engine officer
3. Extract the relevant fields dynamically based on what the document actually contains

The product is in active development. A junior engineer has already built a rough prototype (the PR you will review is theirs). You are joining to lead the backend, architect the production system, and grow the team. This assignment simulates week one.

---

## Part 1 — The Service

### What You Are Building

A production-oriented backend service with the following capabilities:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/extract` | Sync or async | Accept a document, extract structured data via LLM |
| `GET /api/jobs/:jobId` | GET | Poll the status and result of an async extraction job |
| `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId` | GET | Return all extraction records for a session |
| `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/validate` | POST | Cross-document compliance validation |
| `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/report` | GET | Return a structured compliance report for the session |
| `GET /api/health` | GET | Health check endpoint with dependency status |

---

### Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js (TypeScript strongly preferred) or Python (FastAPI)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or SQLite. If PostgreSQL, provide a docker-compose.yml for the DB only.
- **Queue:** Any — BullMQ, pg-boss, a simple in-process queue, or even a naive polling table. The mechanism matters less than the reasoning behind your choice.
- **LLM Provider:** Your choice — see table below

### LLM Provider

Use whichever provider you have access to. What matters is that the model supports vision (image input) and handles base64-encoded documents.

| Provider | Free Tier | Recommended Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Anthropic Claude** | Free credits on signup at console.anthropic.com | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| **Google Gemini** | Generous free quota, no card at aistudio.google.com | `gemini-2.0-flash` |
| **Groq** | Free tier at console.groq.com | `llama-3.2-11b-vision-preview` |
| **Mistral** | Free credits at console.mistral.ai | `pixtral-12b-2409` |
| **OpenAI** | Paid only | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| **Ollama (local)** | Completely free, runs locally | `llava` or `llama3.2-vision` |

> If you have nothing set up, Google AI Studio (Gemini) and Groq both offer free tiers with no credit card required.
> 

**Hard requirement:** LLM provider, model, and API key must be configurable via environment variables (`LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_API_KEY`). The service must not require code changes to swap providers.

---

### Endpoint Specifications

### POST /api/extract

This endpoint must support **two modes**, selected by a query parameter:

- `?mode=sync` — process immediately, block until done, return the full extraction result in the response (default behavior for small files)
- `?mode=async` — accept the upload, enqueue the job, return `202 Accepted` immediately with a `jobId`

**Request**

- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
- Field: `document` (file)
- Field: `sessionId` (string, optional — if omitted, create a new session)
- Accepted types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `application/pdf`
- Max size: 10MB

**Sync response — 200**

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "sessionId": "uuid",
  "fileName": "PEME_Samoya.pdf",
  "documentType": "PEME",
  "documentName": "Pre-Employment Medical Examination",
  "applicableRole": "ENGINE",

  "passportNumber": null,
  "fields": [...],
  "validity": {
    "dateOfIssue": "06/01/2025",
    "dateOfExpiry": "06/01/2027",
    "isExpired": false,
    "daysUntilExpiry": 660,
    "revalidationRequired": false
  },
  "compliance": {...},
  "medicalData": {
    "fitnessResult": "FIT",
    "drugTestResult": "NEGATIVE",
    "restrictions": null,
    "specialNotes": "Schistosomiasis — cleared by hematologist. Cardiac dysrhythmia — Class B, cleared by cardiologist.",

  "isExpired": false,
  "processingTimeMs": 4230,
  "summary": "...",
  "createdAt": "2026-03-17T08:42:11Z"
}
```

**Async response — 202**

```json
{
  "jobId": "uuid",
  "sessionId": "uuid",
  "status": "QUEUED",
  "pollUrl": "/api/jobs/uuid",
  "estimatedWaitMs": 6000
}
```

**Deduplication:** If the same file (matched by SHA-256 hash) is uploaded to the same session, return the existing extraction result immediately with a `200` and a header `X-Deduplicated: true`. Do not call the LLM again.

**Error responses**

| Status | Code | Condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT | File type not accepted |
| 400 | INSUFFICIENT_DOCUMENTS | Validate called with fewer than 2 documents |
| 413 | FILE_TOO_LARGE | File exceeds 10MB |
| 404 | SESSION_NOT_FOUND | Session ID does not exist |
| 404 | JOB_NOT_FOUND | Job ID does not exist |
| 422 | LLM_JSON_PARSE_FAIL | LLM returned unparseable response after retry |
| 429 | RATE_LIMITED | Too many requests — see rate limiting section |
| 500 | INTERNAL_ERROR | Unexpected server error |

All errors follow this shape:

```json
{
  "error": "LLM_JSON_PARSE_FAIL",
  "message": "Document extraction failed after retry. The raw response has been stored for review.",
  "extractionId": "uuid-of-failed-record",
  "retryAfterMs": null
}
```

---

### GET /api/jobs/:jobId

Polls the status of an async extraction job.

**States:** `QUEUED` → `PROCESSING` → `COMPLETE` | `FAILED`

**Response while processing — 200**

```json
{
  "jobId": "uuid",
  "status": "PROCESSING",
  "queuePosition": 2,
  "startedAt": "2026-03-17T08:42:00Z",
  "estimatedCompleteMs": 3200
}
```

**Response when complete — 200**

```json
{
  "jobId": "uuid",
  "status": "COMPLETE",
  "extractionId": "uuid",
  "result": { ... },
  "completedAt": "2026-03-17T08:42:11Z"
}
```

**Response when failed — 200**

```json
{
  "jobId": "uuid",
  "status": "FAILED",
  "error": "LLM_JSON_PARSE_FAIL",
  "message": "...",
  "failedAt": "2026-03-17T08:42:11Z",
  "retryable": true
}
```

---

### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId

Returns a summary of all documents in the session.

```json
{
  "sessionId": "uuid",
  "documentCount": 5,
  "detectedRole": "DECK",
  "overallHealth": "WARN",
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "fileName": "COC_Salonoy.jpg",
      "documentType": "COC",
      "applicableRole": "DECK",
      "holderName": "Francisco J. Salonoy",
      "confidence": "HIGH",
      "isExpired": false,
      "flagCount": 0,
      "criticalFlagCount": 0,
      "createdAt": "2026-03-17T08:40:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "pendingJobs": []
}
```

`overallHealth` is derived client-side from the session data — `OK` if no expired certs and no CRITICAL flags, `WARN` if any MEDIUM or HIGH flags or certs expiring within 90 days, `CRITICAL` if any CRITICAL flags or expired required certs.

---

### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/validate

Sends all extraction records from the session to the LLM for cross-document compliance assessment.

**You must write the LLM prompt for this endpoint yourself.** We provide the extraction prompt for `/api/extract` (see below) but the validation prompt is your design. This is intentional — we want to see how you instruct an LLM to reason about compliance across multiple heterogeneous documents.

The response must include:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "uuid",
  "holderProfile": { ... },
  "consistencyChecks": [ ... ],
  "missingDocuments": [ ... ],
  "expiringDocuments": [ ... ],
  "medicalFlags": [ ... ],
  "overallStatus": "APPROVED | CONDITIONAL | REJECTED",
  "overallScore": 74,
  "summary": "...",
  "recommendations": [ "...", "..." ],
  "validatedAt": "2026-03-17T08:45:00Z"
}
```

---

### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/report

Returns a structured, human-readable compliance report for the session. This is not another LLM call — it is derived entirely from data already in the database (extraction records + the most recent validation result).

The shape is yours to design. Think about what a Manning Agent actually needs to see to make a hire/no-hire decision. We will evaluate the structure and completeness of your report schema as a product thinking signal.

---

### GET /api/health

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "uptime": 3612,
  "dependencies": {
    "database": "OK",
    "llmProvider": "OK",
    "queue": "OK"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-03-17T08:45:00Z"
}
```

---

### Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting on `POST /api/extract` only. The limit is **10 requests per minute per IP**. When the limit is exceeded, return `429 RATE_LIMITED` with a `Retry-After` header and `retryAfterMs` in the body.

You may use any mechanism — an in-memory token bucket, a Redis counter, a middleware library. Document your choice in the ADR.

---

### LLM Reliability Requirements

The LLM is the highest-risk component in the pipeline. Your implementation must handle all of the following:

1. **Malformed JSON** — the LLM sometimes wraps the response in a markdown code fence or adds an explanation before the JSON object. Extract valid JSON by locating the outermost `{` and `}` regardless of surrounding text.
2. **Parse failure recovery** — if extraction fails after the boundary approach, send a repair prompt to the LLM with the raw response and ask it to return clean JSON. Store the raw response regardless.
3. **Timeout handling** — set a 30-second timeout on the LLM API call. On timeout, mark the job `FAILED` with `retryable: true`. Do not hang the request.
4. **LOW confidence retry** — if the LLM returns `confidence: "LOW"`, automatically retry once with a more focused prompt that includes the file name and MIME type as hints. Use the higher-confidence result if the retry succeeds.
5. **Never discard** — even on total failure, store a record with `status: FAILED` and the raw LLM response (or error). Nothing uploaded by the user is ever silently lost.

---

### The LLM Extraction Prompt

Use the following prompt for `POST /api/extract`. Do not modify it — consistent prompt usage across candidates lets us compare extraction quality.

```
You are an expert maritime document analyst with deep knowledge of STCW, MARINA, IMO, and international seafarer certification standards.

A document has been provided. Perform the following in a single pass:
1. IDENTIFY the document type from the taxonomy below
2. DETERMINE if this belongs to a DECK officer, ENGINE officer, BOTH, or is role-agnostic (N/A)
3. EXTRACT all fields that are meaningful for this specific document type
4. FLAG any compliance issues, anomalies, or concerns

Document type taxonomy (use these exact codes):
COC | COP_BT | COP_PSCRB | COP_AFF | COP_MEFA | COP_MECA | COP_SSO | COP_SDSD |
ECDIS_GENERIC | ECDIS_TYPE | SIRB | PASSPORT | PEME | DRUG_TEST | YELLOW_FEVER |
ERM | MARPOL | SULPHUR_CAP | BALLAST_WATER | HATCH_COVER | BRM_SSBT |
TRAIN_TRAINER | HAZMAT | FLAG_STATE | OTHER

Return ONLY a valid JSON object. No markdown. No code fences. No preamble.

}
```

---

### Database Schema

Design your own schema. The suggested schema below is a starting point only — we will evaluate your schema design as part of the technical review. Consider: what indexes will you need? How do you model job state? How do you avoid JSONB columns becoming a dumping ground?

```sql
-- Starting point only — modify freely

CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE extractions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id),
  file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  document_type TEXT,
  applicable_role TEXT,
  confidence TEXT,
  holder_name TEXT,
  date_of_birth TEXT,
  sirb_number TEXT,
  passport_number TEXT,
  fields_json TEXT,
  validity_json TEXT,
  medical_data_json TEXT,
  flags_json TEXT,
  is_expired INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  summary TEXT,
  raw_llm_response TEXT,
  processing_time_ms INTEGER,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'COMPLETE',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE jobs (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id TEXT REFERENCES sessions(id),
  extraction_id TEXT REFERENCES extractions(id),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'QUEUED',
  error_code TEXT,
  error_message TEXT,
  queued_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  started_at TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE validations (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id),
  result_json TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Part 2 — Architecture Decision Record

Write a short ADR document (500–800 words, markdown is fine, include it as `ADR.md` in the repo root) covering the following questions. Answer each one directly — we are not looking for hedged non-answers.

**Question 1 — Sync vs Async**
You implemented a `?mode=sync` and `?mode=async` option. In production, which mode should be the default and why? At what file size or concurrency threshold would you force async regardless of the mode param?

**Question 2 — Queue Choice**
What queue mechanism did you use and why? What would you migrate to if this service needed to handle 500 concurrent extractions per minute? What are the failure modes of your current approach?

**Question 3 — LLM Provider Abstraction**
Did you build a provider interface that makes swapping LLMs trivial, or did you implement against one provider directly? Justify the decision. If you did build the abstraction, describe its interface.

**Question 4 — Schema Design**
The suggested schema uses JSONB/TEXT columns for dynamic fields. What are the risks of that approach at scale? What would you change if this system needed to support full-text search across extracted field values, or querying "all sessions where any document has an expired COC"?

**Question 5 — What You Skipped**
What did you deliberately not implement that a production system would require? List at least three things and briefly explain why you deprioritized each.

---

## Part 3 — Code Review

Below is a pull request submitted by a junior engineer on the team. Review it as you would in a real code review — written comments on specific lines or sections, a summary comment at the top explaining your overall assessment, and at least one thing you would specifically call out as a teaching moment.

Your review will be evaluated on: technical accuracy, tone (is it constructive?), whether you identify the real problems vs. surface issues, and whether your feedback would actually help a junior engineer grow.

**The PR: "feat: add document extraction endpoint"**

```tsx
// src/routes/extract.ts
import express from 'express';
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

const router = express.Router();
const client = new Anthropic({ apiKey: 'sk-ant-REDACTED' });

router.post('/extract', async (req, res) => {
  const file = req.file;

  if (!file) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: 'No file uploaded' });
    return;
  }

  try {
    // Read the file and convert to base64
    const fileData = fs.readFileSync(file.path);
    const base64Data = fileData.toString('base64');

    // Save file to disk permanently for reference
    const savedPath = path.join('./uploads', file.originalname);
    fs.copyFileSync(file.path, savedPath);

    const response = await client.messages.create({
      model: 'claude-opus-4-6',
      max_tokens: 4096,
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: [
            {
              type: 'image',
              source: {
                type: 'base64',
                media_type: file.mimetype,
                data: base64Data,
              },
            },
            {
              type: 'text',
              text: 'Extract all information from this maritime document and return as JSON.',
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    });

    const result = JSON.parse(response.content[0].text);

    // Store in memory for now
    global.extractions = global.extractions || [];
    global.extractions.push(result);

    res.json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong' });
  }
});

export default router;
```

**PR description written by the junior engineer:**

> "Added the main extract endpoint. It reads the uploaded file, converts to base64, sends to Claude, parses the JSON back, and returns it. Also saves files to disk so we don't lose them. Tested with one PEME file and it worked. Using Opus because it gave better results in my testing."
> 

Submit your code review as `CODE_REVIEW.md` in the repo root. Write it as if you are posting it in GitHub — address the junior engineer directly.

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical (50%)

| Area | What We Look For |
| --- | --- |
| LLM reliability | JSON extraction robustness, repair strategy, no silent failures, raw response always stored |
| Async pipeline | Job state machine is correct, polling endpoint handles all states, queue does not drop jobs on restart |
| API design | Consistent error shapes, sync/async modes work correctly, deduplication works, rate limiting returns correct headers |
| Schema design | Indexes exist where needed, job table is correct, schema choices are defensible in the ADR |
| Code quality | TypeScript types are real (no `any` dumps), separation of concerns, no hardcoded credentials, README runs in 3 commands |
| Testing | At minimum: JSON repair logic has unit tests, happy path has an integration test or Postman collection |

### Architecture & Judgment (25%)

| Area | What We Look For |
| --- | --- |
| ADR quality | Direct answers, real tradeoffs named, honest about what was skipped |
| Report endpoint design | Does the schema reflect genuine product thinking about what a Manning Agent needs? |
| Validation prompt | Is the cross-document compliance prompt precise, well-structured, and would it produce reliable output? |
| Schema evolution | Did you think about query patterns beyond just "store and retrieve"? |

### Leadership (25%)

| Area | What We Look For |
| --- | --- |
| Code review tone | Constructive and specific — does not berate, does not approve bad code uncritically |
| Code review accuracy | Identifies the real issues (hardcoded key, Opus cost, global state, no timeout, broad prompt, saved files with PII) not just style nits |
| Teaching quality | At least one comment explains *why* something is wrong, not just *that* it is wrong |
| Loom walkthrough | Can you explain architectural decisions clearly to a non-technical audience in 2 minutes and a technical one in 5? |

---

## What a Lead-Level Submission Looks Like

A strong submission will:

- Make a clear, justified call on sync vs async default and document it
- Have a job state machine that handles `QUEUED → PROCESSING → COMPLETE/FAILED` correctly with no orphaned jobs
- Write a cross-document validation prompt that would genuinely work in production — specific, structured, and resistant to hallucination
- Design a `/report` endpoint schema that a product manager could read without translation
- Deliver a code review that a junior engineer would actually learn from — specific line references, clear reasoning, one teaching moment they will remember
- Have an ADR that names what was skipped and why without defensiveness

A strong submission will not:

- Hardcode credentials anywhere in the source
- Use `any` types as a crutch in TypeScript
- Silently drop failed extractions
- Write a validation prompt that just asks the LLM to "check if the documents are valid"
- Write a code review that is only style comments
- Have a README that requires 20 minutes of setup

---

## Bonus (Optional)

These are not required. Each one is an opportunity to signal specific depth.

- **Webhook support** — add an optional `webhookUrl` field to the `POST /api/extract` request. When the async job completes, POST the result to that URL with an HMAC signature for verification.
- **Retry endpoint** — add `POST /api/jobs/:jobId/retry` that re-queues a failed job. Must reject if the job is not in `FAILED` state.
- **Expiry alerting query** — add `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/expiring?withinDays=90` that returns all documents in the session that expire within the given window, sorted by urgency. This must be a database query, not an in-memory filter.
- **Provider benchmark** — test your extraction prompt against two different LLM providers using the same document. Include a brief comparison (accuracy, speed, cost) in the ADR.
- **Prompt versioning** — store the prompt version used for each extraction in the database. Expose it in the extraction record as `promptVersion`. Explain in the ADR why prompt versioning matters for a production system.

---

## Submission Instructions

1. Push to a GitHub repository (public, or share access with the hiring contact)
2. Ensure the repo contains:
    - Working service code
    - `ADR.md` — Architecture Decision Record
    - `CODE_REVIEW.md` — your review of the junior engineer's PR
    - `README.md` — setup and run instructions (must work in under 5 minutes)
    - `.env.example` — template with all required environment variables
3. Record a 10–15 min Loom covering:
    - Live demo of `POST /api/extract` in both sync and async mode
    - Live demo of `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/validate`
    - A 2-minute explanation of your queue approach and why
    - One thing you would change if you had more time and why
4. Send both links to the hiring contact

If you do not have real seafarer documents to test with, any scanned ID, certificate, or invoice will work — the LLM will return `OTHER` or LOW confidence, which is valid and tests your fallback handling.

---

## Questions

Email the hiring contact before starting if anything is unclear. We prefer one good clarifying question upfront over a submission that went in the wrong direction.

We are hiring someone who will own the backend architecture of this product and grow the engineers building it. The code matters. The decisions behind the code matter more. The ability to communicate those decisions to a team is what makes someone a lead.

Good luck.
